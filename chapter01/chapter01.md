##List comprehensions

List comprehensions are a way to filter, transform, and combine lists.

##Tuples
Tuples are used to store several heterogeneous elements as in a single value.
Functions that operate on pairs:

* fst: takes a pair and returns its first component e.g.: fst (8,11) = 8
* snd: takes a pair and returns its second component e.g.: snd ("Wow", False) = False
